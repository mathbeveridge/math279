 Here are the  definitions of even and odd.
<ul>
<li>
An integer <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> is even when there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>n = 2k</m>.
</li>
<li>
An integer <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> is odd when there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>n = 2k+1</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Here are the definitions of divisible and not divisible.
Let <m>n,d \in \mathbb{Z}</m> be  integers.
<ul>
<li>
 We say that
<m>d \mid n</m> when there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>n=dk</m>. 
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, we say that <m>d \nmid n</m>. This means that
<m>n \neq dk</m> for all <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.

</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Use these definitions to prove the following statements.

			<idx><h>Odd to Even</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Prove that for all integers <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, if <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>5n + 3 </m> is even.



				</p>
			</statement>
					
			<solution>
			<p>
			We have <m>n=2r+1</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
			Therefore 
			<me>
			5n+3 = 5(2r+1)+3 = 10r+8 = 2(5r+4).
			</me>
			Taking <m>s=5r+4</m>, we have <m>5n+3=2s</m>, which proves that <m>5n+3</m> is even.

			<statement>
				<p>
Prove that if <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, then <m>5n^2+3n+7</m> is odd.



				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>There are two cases: when <m>n</m> is odd and when <m>n</m> is even.</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Case 1:</strong> <m>n</m> is odd. We have <m>n=2r+1</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
			Therefore 
			<md>
			<mrow>
			5n^2+3n+7 &amp; = 5(2r+1)^2+3(2r+1)+7 
			= (20r^2 + 20r+ 5) + (6r+3) + 7
			</mrow>
			<mrow>		
			&amp; = 20r^2 + 26r+15
			= 2(10r^2+13r+7) +1.
			</mrow>
			</md>
			Taking <m>s=10r^2+13r+7</m>, we have <m>5n^2+3n+7=2s+1</m>, 
			which proves that <m>5n^2+3n+7</m> is odd.
			</p>	
			<p>
			<strong>Case 2:</strong> <m>n</m> is even. We have <m>n=2r</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
			Therefore 
			<me>
			5n^2+3n+7 = 5(2r)^2+3(2r)+7 
			= 20r^2  + 6r + 7 
			= 2(10r^2+3r+3) +1.
			</me>
			Taking <m>s=10r^2+3r+3</m>, we have <m>5n^2+3n+7=2s+1</m>, 
			which proves that <m>5n^2+3n+7</m> is odd.

			<title>Even/Odd Combo</title>
			<idx><h>Even/Odd Combo</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Prove that if <m>a</m> is any odd integer and <m>b</m> is any even integer, then <m>2a+3b</m> is an even integer.



				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
			We have <m>a=2r+1</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
			and <m>b=2s</m> for some <m>s \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
			Therefore 
			<me>
			2a+3b = 2(2r+1) + 3(2s) = 4r+6s+2 = 2(2r+3s+1)
			</me>
			Taking <m>t=2r+3s+1</m>, we have <m>2a+3b=2t</m>, 
			which proves that <m>5n^2+3n+7</m> is even.

			<title>Summing Squares </title>
			<idx><h>Summing Squares </h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Prove that if <m>a</m> is any odd integer and <m>b</m> is any even integer, then <m>a^2+b^2</m> is an odd integer.



				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
			We have <m>a=2r+1</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
			and <m>b=2s</m> for some <m>s \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
			Therefore 
			<me>
			a^2 + b^2 = (2r+1)^2 + (2s)^2 = 4r^2 +  4r + 4s^2 + 1
			= 2(2r^2+ 2r+2s^2) +1
			</me>
			Taking <m>t=2r^2+ 2r+2s^2</m>, we have <m>a^2+b^2=2t+1</m>, 
			which proves that <m>5n^2+3n+7</m> is odd.

        <exercise>
			<title>Proof by Contrapositive</title>
			<idx><h>Proof by Contrapositive</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Use a proof by contrapositive to show that for all integers <m>m,n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, 
if  <m>mn</m> is even then <m>m</m> is even or <m>n</m> is even.

				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
			The contrapositive of the statement is: if <m>m</m> is odd and <m>n</m> is odd then <m>mn</m> is odd.
			Let's prove this statment. We have <m>m=2r+1</m> and <m>n=2s+1</m> for some <m>r,s \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
			Then
			<me>
			mn = (2r+1)(2s+1) = 4rs+2r+2s+1 = 2(2rs+r+s)+1.
			</me>
			Taking <m>t=2rs+r+s</m>, we have <m>mn= 2t+1</m> and therefore <m>mn</m> is odd.
			We have proved the contrapositive, so the original statement is also true 
			(because an implication and its contrapositive have the same truth values).

        <exercise>
			<title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
			<idx><h>Proof by Contradiction</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Use a proof by contradiction to show that for any integer <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, 
we have <m>4 \nmid n^2-2.</m>

				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
			Assume for the sake of contradiction (AFSOC) that <m>4 \mid n^2-2.</m> This means that 
			<m>n^2-2 = 4k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
			We have two cases.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Case 1:</strong> <m>n</m> is odd. We have <m>n=2r+1</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
			We now have
			<md>
			<mrow>
			(2r+1)^2-2 &amp; = 4k
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
			4r^2+4r-1 &amp; = 4k
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
			4r^2+4r-4k &amp; = 1
			</mrow>	
			<mrow>
			2(2r^2+2r-2k) &amp; = 1
			</mrow>		
			<mrow>
			2r^2+2r-2k &amp; = \frac{1}{2}
			</mrow>					
			</md>
			which is a contradiction because the left hand size is an integer, while the right hand side is not.
			Therefore <m>4 \nmid n^2-2</m> when <m>n</m> is odd.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Case 2:</strong> <m>n</m> is even. We have <m>n=2r</m> for some <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
			We now have
			<md>
			<mrow>
			(2r)^2-2 &amp; = 4k
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
			4r^2-2 &amp; = 2k
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
			4r^2-4k &amp; = 2
			</mrow>	
			<mrow>
			2(r^2-k) &amp; = 1
			</mrow>		
			<mrow>
			r^2-k &amp; = \frac{1}{2}
			</mrow>					
			</md>
			which is a contradiction because the left hand size is an integer, while the right hand side is not.
			Therefore <m>4 \nmid n^2-2</m> when <m>n</m> is even.
			</p>			
			</solution>

        <exercise>
			<title>Your Choice</title>
			<idx><h>Your Choice</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Prove the following statement using either proof by contrapositive, or proof by contradiction.
				</p>
                <p>
                For positive integers <m>a,b,n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, if <m>ab = n</m>, then either 
                <m>a \geq \sqrt{n}</m> or <m>b \geq \sqrt{n}</m>.
                </p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
			<p>
			Here is a proof by contrapositive.
			We must prove that if <m>a &lt; \sqrt{n}</m> and <m>b &lt; \sqrt{n}</m> then
			<m>ab \neq n</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
			So assume that <m>a &lt; \sqrt{n}</m> and <m>b &lt; \sqrt{n}</m>. We have
			<me>
			ab &lt; \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} = n.
			</me>
			Now, we have <m>ab &lt; n</m>, so of course <m>ab \neq n</m>. We have proved that the 
			contrapositive statement is true, so the original implication is true as well.
			</p>			
			</solution>
