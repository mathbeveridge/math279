 Create the complete game trees for  positions (a) and  (b) above. Label the leaves (terminal positions) as <m>\cP</m> and then work your way up the tree, marking each position with an <m>\cN</m> or a <m>\cP</m>. Remember to follow the two rules:
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 An <m>\cN</m>-position must have at least one follower that is a <m>\cP</m>-position.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Every follower of a <m>\cP</m>-position  must be an <m>\cN</m>-position.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

 Create the complete game tree for  position (c) above, as you did in problem 2. Mark each position with an <m>\cN</m> or a <m>\cP</m>.
Once you are done, compare your answer to this problem with the trees in problem 2. Make any useful observations that you can.
