<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>Let \(P = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)\) be a path of maximum length. We claim that the endpoints \(v_1, v_k\) of \(P\) are leaves. AFSOC that \(v_1\) is not a leaf. Then \(v_1\) has another neighbor \(u\) besides \(v_2\text{.}\) Since \(G\) is a tree, this neighbor is not already on the path \(P\) because this new edge would create a cycle. But then we can find a longer path by adding the edge from \(v_1\) to \(u\text{,}\) a contradiction. The same argument applies to \(v_k\text{.}\) Therefore \(v_1, v_k\) are both leaves in \(G\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
