<p>Here are four reasons why this phrasing is NOT a paradox. The first three tackle implicit (and possibly incorrect) assumptions about the barber. The last reason actually shows that the reader has actually made a logical mistake!</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The clearest way out is when <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">the barber is not a man</em>. The barber could be a woman or non-gender conforming. Ages ago, the word "barber" required that the person was male. But this is clearly not the case in our modern times. Therefore, we must update the "barber paradox" to explicitly state that the barber is man.</p></li>
<li><p>The second assumption is that <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">the barber is a person who shaves</em>. This assumption could be wrong, even if the barber is a man. (And there is nothing like a huge, unkept beard to inspire confidence in a barber's clients.)</p></li>
<li><p>The barber is a  man <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">in town</em>. Hundreds of years ago, you had to live in the same town in which you worked. What would "in town" mean in our modern times, when people commute to work?</p></li>
<li>
<p>But let's assume that the barber is male gendered,  that he shaves, and that he lives in town.  The classic phrasing actually <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">says NOTHING about men who shaves themselves</em>. A male barber is free to shave himself, since the statement does not preclude him doing so.</p>
<p>Here is why. The statement is: "The barber  shaves all men who do not shave  themselves." This is equivalent to saying "If man \(M\) does not shave himself, then the barber shaves \(M\text{.}\)" What if \(M\) does shave himself? The implication does not tell us anything at all about \(M\text{.}\)</p>
<p>So the barber shaves himself, and that fact is logically consistent with the statement that "The barber  shaves all men who do not shave  themselves."</p>
</li>
</ul>
