<p>Assume that there is a unique path between each pair of vertices in \(G\text{.}\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The graph is connected: a path between \(u\) and \(v\) is a walk between \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\) So each pair of vertices is joined by a walk.</p></li>
<li><p>AFSOC that there is a cycle \(C\) in the graph. Let \(e=(u,v)\) be an edge in \(C\text{.}\) Then there are two paths between these vertices: the edge \(e\) and \(C-e\text{,}\) the cycle minus this edge. This contradicts the fact that there is a unique path between \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\)</p></li>
