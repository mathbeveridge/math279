<p>Use \((\star)\) to prove that any \(2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}\) board that is missing one square can be covered by triominoes.</p>
<p>By splitting the board down the middle (both horizontally and vertically, we now have the option to think of this one board as four independent \(2^n \times 2^n\) boards. In particular, if we place a triomino in the middle so that it has one square in each of the three smaller boards that have  no missing square, then we end up with 4 independent instances of the problem using  \(2^n \times 2^n\) boards  (each missing one square).</p>
<p>By \((\star)\text{,}\) we can cover each of these four boards using triominoes. When we put them all together, we get a covering of the \(2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}\) board that is missing one square.</p>
