<p>The barber is a man, and (1) he shaves all men who don't shave themselves and (2) he doesn't shave any man who shaves himself. So this is becomes an "if and only if" statement. This leads to the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The barber cannot shave himself because (by definition), he only shaves men who do not shave themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if the barber does not shave himself, then he is one of the men shaved by the barber.</p></li>
<li><p>But the barber only shaves men who don't shave themselves. This brings us back where we started.</p></li>
<li><p>This loop continues forever without resolution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">This is an example of how self-referential statements can lead to paradoxes. So this sentence is problematic. A mathematician would say that a paradox is NOT a mathematical statement, because it is neither true nor false.</p>
