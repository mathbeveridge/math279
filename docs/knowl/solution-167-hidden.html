<p>The states with odd degrees are (from left to right): CA, NV, UT, ND, TX, MO, LA, IL, KY, OH, WV, GA, MD, NC, VT, NY, NJ, DE, NH, MA, CT, ME. Observe that ND is at least 3 steps away from all the other odd degree vertices. We can pair it up with UT at a cost of 3, and we cannot do any better. So we can double the edges (ND, MT), (MT, ID), (ID, UT) (or we can pick another path of length 3 between ND and UT).</p>
<p>We can pair the remaining odd states with an odd neighboring state as follows: (CA, NV) (UT,  ND) (MO, IL) (TX, LA) (VT, NY) (NJ, DE)  \\ (MA, CT) (NH, ME) (KY, OH) ((WV, MD) (GA,  NC) We must double a total of 14 edges to solve the Postman Problem.</p>
