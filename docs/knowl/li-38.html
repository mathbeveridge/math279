<p>But let's assume that the barber is male gendered,  that he shaves, and that he lives in town.  The classic phrasing actually <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">says NOTHING about men who shaves themselves</em>. A male barber is free to shave himself, since the statement does not preclude him doing so.</p>
<p>Here is why. The statement is: "The barber  shaves all men who do not shave  themselves." This is equivalent to saying "If man \(M\) does not shave himself, then the barber shaves \(M\text{.}\)" What if \(M\) does shave himself? The implication does not tell us anything at all about \(M\text{.}\)</p>
<p>So the barber shaves himself, and that fact is logically consistent with the statement that "The barber  shaves all men who do not shave  themselves."</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-1.html#li-38">in-context</a></span>
