<p>Show that in a pie fight between \(2(k+1)+1=2k+3\) people, then there is at least one person who is not hit by a pie.</p>
<p>Consider a pie fight between \(2(k+1)+1 =2k+3\) people. Again, let Alice and Bob be the two people separated by the minimum distance. There are two cases.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Case 1:</em> No one else throws a pie at Alice or Bob. Excluding Alice and Bob, we have a pie fight between \(2k+1\) people. By induction, there is at least one person who is not hit by a pie.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Case 2:</em> Someone else throws a pie at Alice or Bob. Excluding Alice and Bob, there are \(2k\) pies left to be thrown, and \(2k+1\) people. Therefore at least one person is not hit by a pie.</p></li>
