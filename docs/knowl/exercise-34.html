<p>In each of the following problems, give an example of a function \(f: [n] \rightarrow [m]\) of the specified type. <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">You get to pick the values for \(n\) and \(m\text{.}\)</em> Describe your function by using a picture. Then decide if there is a required relationship between \(n\) and \(m\text{,}\) the sizes of the domain and the codomain (also called the "target").</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a function \(f: [n] \rightarrow [m]\) that is injective (one-to-one) but NOT surjective (onto). What is the required relationship between \(n\) and \(m\text{?}\) (One of: \(n  &gt;m\) or \(n &lt; m\) or \(n = m\) or "none.") </p></li>
