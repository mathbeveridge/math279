<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>By splitting the board down the middle (both horizontally and vertically), we now have the option to think of this one board as four independent boards. In particular, if we place a triomino in the middle so that it has one square in each of the three smaller boards that have  one missing square, then we end up with 4 independent instances of \(4 \times 4\) boards.</p></div></body>
