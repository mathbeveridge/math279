<p>Let \(G\) be a connected graph vertices where every degree is even.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Base Case:</em> \(G\) is a cycle, so \(m=n\text{.}\) Clearly a cycle is an Eulerian circuit.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume that a connected graph \(G\) where every degree is even and \(|E| &lt; m\) has an Eulerian cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Inductive Step:</em> Consider a graph \(G\) where every degree is even and \(|E|=m\text{.}\) Start at any vertex \(v\) and walk without repeating edges until you return to \(v\text{.}\) You cannot get stuck along the way since every vertex has even degree: if you enter a vertex then there must be an edge available to leave the vertex. Call this resulting circuit \(W\text{.}\) Now look at \(H=G-W\text{.}\) Every vertex of graph \(H\) has even degree, but it may have multiple components. Each component has fewer than \(m\) edges, so these components each have an Eulerian Circuit. We can splice these together along with the circuit \(W\) to create an Eulerian Circuit for \(G\text{.}\)</p></li>
