<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Case 1:</em> You start with an odd number of heads. Remove the leftmost heads up coin and flip its neighbors. This leaves two smaller lists of coins, \(L\) and \(R\text{,}\) which are to the left and right of the coin you removed. One of these sets could be empty; why? What can you say about the configuration of coins in each of \(L\) and \(R\text{?}\) Explain why this proves that the original configuration was winning/losing. </p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Case 2:</em> You start with an even number of heads. Pick any heads-up coin, remove it and flip its neighbors. Once again, this leaves two smaller lists of coins, \(L\) and \(R\text{.}\) Explain why one of these sets must contain an even number of heads-up coins. Explain why this proves that the original configuration was winning/losing. </p></li>
