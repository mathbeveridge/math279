</h6>
<p>Let's play a coin flipping game. Start with \(n\) coins arranged in a row. Some show heads and some show tails. On each move, you must:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Pick a heads-up coin and remove it.</p></li>
<li><p>Then flip the coins still present in the (at most) two neighbor spots surrounding it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">This diagram shows all three valid moves from this starting postion: <div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="images/fig-img-induction23.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Note that <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">removing a coin leaves an empty space</em>. So that coin is now missing, so the coins you flipped are now missing a neighbor. <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">The Question:</em> For which arrangements of heads and tails can we remove all coins?</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Play the coin removal game with \(n\) coins for \(n=1,2,3\text{.}\) For each \(n\text{,}\) list the starting configurations that are winning and losing. Can you see the pattern?</p></li>
<li><p>Now play some games on \(n=4,5,6\) coins. Make a conjecture about which starting positions are winning and which ones are losing.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We now prove this by induction.</p>
<p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Base Case:</em> Your answers from part (a) are your base case for \(n=1,2,3\) (of course, you only need the base case \(n=1\) for a full proof).</p>
<p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Inductive Hypothesis:</em> When \(k &lt; n\text{,}\) the winning \&amp; losing positions are as described in part (b).</p>
<p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Inductive Step:</em> Consider a starting position with \(n&gt;1\) coins.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>{\bf{Case 1:}} You start with an odd number of heads. Remove the leftmost heads up coin and flip its neighbors. This leaves two smaller lists of coins, \(L\) and \(R\text{,}\) which are to the left and right of the coin you removed. One of these sets could be empty; why? What can you say about the configuration of coins in each of \(L\) and \(R\text{?}\) Explain why this proves that the original configuration was winning/losing.</p></li>
<li><p>{\bf{Case 2:}} You start with an even number of heads. Pick any heads-up coin, remove it and flip its neighbors. Once again, this leaves two smaller lists of coins, \(L\) and \(R\text{.}\) Explain why one of these sets must contain an even number of heads-up coins. Explain why this proves that the original configuration was winning/losing.</p></li>
