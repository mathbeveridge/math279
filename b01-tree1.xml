More generally, consider the set of trees on <m>n \geq 3</m> vertices. Which tree has the fewest leaves? Which tree has the most leaves? Draw these trees and state how many leaves each has.

			<title>A Tree Has At Least 2 Leaves</title>
			<idx><h>A Tree Has At Least 2 Leaves</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In this problem, you will give <em>another proof</em> that a tree on <m>n \geq 3</m> has at least two leaves (recall that a leaf is a vertex with degree equal 1). Let <m>G</m> be a tree on <m>n\geq 3</m> vertices. Let <m>S</m> be the set of all paths from one vertex to another on <m>G</m>. Among all the paths in <m>S</m>, let <m>P</m> be a path with the most edges.

			</p><p>

How does this path <m>P</m> help us to find two leaves?

			<statement>
				<p>
Here is a theorem that gives four different ways to describe a tree.

			</p><p>

<em>Theorem:</em> The following statements are equivalent for a graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> on <m>n</m> vertices
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected and acyclic
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected and <m>|E|=n-1</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is acyclic  and <m>|E|=n-1</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 There is a unique path between each pair of vertices in <m>G</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected but deleting any edge disconnects the graph.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			</p><p>

We will focus on (d) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) and the equivalence (a) <m>\Leftrightarrow</m> (e).




			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (d) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) using a proof by contradiction. Assuming that (d) holds, why must <m>G</m> be connected? Why must <m>G</m> be acyclic?


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (a) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (e) using a proof by contradiction. Assume that (a) holds, but there is an edge <m>e</m> such that the graph <m>G-e</m> obtained by removing <m>e</m> is connected. Why does this lead to a contradiction?



					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (e) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) by proving the contrapositive statement "not (a) <m>\Rightarrow</m> not (e)."
