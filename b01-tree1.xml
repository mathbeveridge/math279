			<title>Leaves on Trees</title>

More generally, consider the set of trees on <m>n \geq 3</m> vertices. Which tree has the fewest leaves? Which tree has the most leaves? Draw these trees and state how many leaves each has.

The path <m>P_n</m> has the fewest leaves: it has 2 of them. The star <m>S_n</m>, consisting of one central hub vertex and <m>n-1</m> leaves, has the most.

			<title>A Tree Has At Least 2 Leaves</title>
			<idx><h>A Tree Has At Least 2 Leaves</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In this problem, you will give <em>another proof</em> that a tree on <m>n \geq 3</m> has at least two leaves (recall that a leaf is a vertex with degree equal 1). Let <m>G</m> be a tree on <m>n\geq 3</m> vertices. Let <m>S</m> be the set of all paths from one vertex to another on <m>G</m>. Among all the paths in <m>S</m>, let <m>P</m> be a path with the most edges.

			</p><p>

How does this path <m>P</m> help us to find two leaves?

<!--solution>
<p>

Let <m>P = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)</m> be a path of maximum length. We claim that the endpoints <m>v_1, v_k</m> of <m>P</m> are leaves. AFSOC that <m>v_1</m> is not a leaf. Then <m>v_1</m> has another neighbor <m>u</m> besides <m>v_2</m>. Since <m>G</m> is a tree, this neighbor is not already on the path <m>P</m> because this new edge would create a cycle. But then we can find a longer path by adding the edge from <m>v_1</m> to <m>u</m>, a contradiction.

The same argument applies to <m>v_k</m>. Therefore <m>v_1, v_k</m> are both leaves in <m>G</m>.

			<title>Definitions for a Tree</title>

			<statement>
				<p>
Here is a theorem that gives four different ways to describe a tree.

			</p><p>

<em>Theorem:</em> The following statements are equivalent for a graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> on <m>n</m> vertices
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected and acyclic
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected and <m>|E|=n-1</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is acyclic  and <m>|E|=n-1</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 There is a unique path between each pair of vertices in <m>G</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>G</m> is connected but deleting any edge disconnects the graph.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			</p><p>

We will focus on (d) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) and the equivalence (a) <m>\Leftrightarrow</m> (e).




			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (d) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) using a proof by contradiction. Assuming that (d) holds, why must <m>G</m> be connected? Why must <m>G</m> be acyclic?

<!--solution>
<p>
Assume that there is a unique path between each pair of vertices in <m>G</m>.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 The graph is connected: a path between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is a walk between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>. So each pair of vertices is joined by a walk.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 AFSOC that there is a cycle <m>C</m> in the graph. Let <m>e=(u,v)</m> be an edge in <m>C</m>. Then there are two paths between these vertices: the edge <m>e</m> and <m>C-e</m>, the cycle minus this edge. This contradicts the fact that there is a unique path between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (a) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (e) using a proof by contradiction. Assume that (a) holds, but there is an edge <m>e</m> such that the graph <m>G-e</m> obtained by removing <m>e</m> is connected. Why does this lead to a contradiction?

<!--solution>
<p>
Let <m>G</m> be connected and acyclic. AFSOC that  there is an edge <m>e=(u,v)</m> such that the graph <m>G-e</m> obtained by removing <m>e</m> is connected. This means that there is a <m>(u,v)</m>-path <m>P</m> in <m>G-e</m>. But then <m>P+e</m> is a cycle in <m>G</m>, a contradiction.
</p>
</solution-->


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that (e) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (a) by proving the contrapositive statement "not (a) <m>\Rightarrow</m> not (e)."

<!--solution>
<p>
Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph. We prove that if <m>G</m> contains a cycle then there exists an edge <m>e</m> such that <m>G-e</m> is connected.

Pick a cycle <m>C</m> in the graph and let <m>e=(u,v)</m> be an edge in <m>C</m>. Then <m>P=C-e</m> is a path in <m>G-e</m>. We now show that <m>G-e</m> is connected. Intuitively, any <m>(x,y)</m>-path that uses <m>e</m> can be "re-rerouted" to use the other part of the cycle instead.

Let <m>x,y</m> be any two vertices. Since <m>G</m> is connected, there is a walk <m>Q</m> from <m>x</m> to <m>y</m>. If <m>e \notin Q</m> then <m>Q</m> is a walk in <m>G-e</m>. If <m>e \in Q</m>, then we can split <m>Q</m> into <m>Q_1 \cup e \cup Q_2</m> where <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_2</m> are walks. But then <m>Q_1 + P + Q_2</m> is an <m>(x,y)</m>-walk in <m>G-e</m>. Therefore, <m>G-e</m> is connected.
