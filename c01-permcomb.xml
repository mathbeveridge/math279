		<p>


Here are the formulas to count  sublists and subsets of the set <m>[n] = \{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 A <em>permutation</em> of <m>[n]</m> is an ordered list of its elements. The number of permutations of <m>[n]</m> is
<me>
n! = n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots 2 \cdot 1.
</me>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 A  <m>k</m>-<em>list</em> of <m>[n]</m> (also called a <m>k</m><em>-permutation</em>) is an ordered list of <m>k</m> elements of <m>[n]</m>. The number of <m>k</m>-lists of <m>[n]</m> is
<me>
P(n,k) = (n)_k = n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
</me>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 A <m>k</m><em>-set</em> of <m>[n]</m> (also called a <m>k</m><em>-combination</em>) is a subset containing <m>k</m> elements of <m>[n]</m>. The number of <m>k</m>-sets of <m>[n]</m> is
<me>
C(n,k) = {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.
</me>
			</p>
			</li>

			<title>Bus Stop</title>
			<idx><h>Bus Stop</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Four adults and seven children are waiting at a bus stop.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many ways can they sit in a row?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
11!
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many ways can they sit in a row if the adults must sit together and the children must sit together?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
2 \times 4! \times 7!
</me>
The factor of 2 comes from the fact that the children can be to the left or the right of the adults.
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many ways can they sit in a row if the the children must sit together?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
7! \times 5!
</me>
We seat the children in <m>7!</m> ways and them treat them as one "person" who must be seated with the four adults.
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many ways can they sit in a row if <em>just</em> the children are sitting together (and the adults must not sit together)?

<!--solution>
<p>
Let's use "good = all - bad." We count the ways that the children can sit together and subtract the number of ways that both the children and the adults are sitting together.
<me>
7! \times 5! - 2 \times 4! \times 7!
</me>

			<title>In the Queue</title>
			<idx><h>In the Queue</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
How many ways can 10 adults and 5 children stand in a line so that no two children are standing next to each other? (Hint: place the adults first, and then the children.)

<!--solution>
<p>
First we line up the adults, and there are <m>10!</m> ways to do so. Now there are 11 spots to place the 5 children: at the front of the line, or behind the <m>k</m>th adult, where <m>1 \leq k \leq 10</m>. Therefore there are <m>(11)_5</m> ways to place the children. So the final answer is
<me>
10! \times (11)_5 = 10! \, P(11,5).
</me>

			<title>Forming a Circle</title>
			<idx><h>Forming a Circle</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In how many ways can <m>n</m> people stand in a circle? (How is this problem different from standing in a line?)

<!--solution>
<p>
When standing in the circle, we have a rotational symmetry that does not appear when standing a line. For <m>0 \leq k \leq n-1</m>, everyone can move counterclockwise by <m>k</m> spots, and we still have the same configuration. Therefore the total number of circular configurations is

<me>
\frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!
</me>

			<idx><h>Five Digits, No Zeros</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many 5-digit numbers are there where no digit repeats and only the digits 1-9 appear?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
(9)_5 = P(9,5)
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use inclusion-exclusion to determine how many numbers in part (a) contain a 3 and a 6. (Hint: you will need to use "good = all - bad.")

<!--solution>
<p>
The bad numbers are the ones that don't contain both a 3 and a 6. Using inclusion-exclusion, there are
<me>
(8)_5 + (8)_5 - (7)_5 = P(8,5) + P(8,5) - P(7,5)
</me>
bad numbers. Therefore we have
<me>
(9)_5 - 2 (8)_5 + (7)_5 = p(9,5) - 2 P(8,5) + P(7,5)
</me>
good numbers.

			<title>Coin Toss</title>

			<statement>
				<p>
A coin is tossed 10 times and a sequence of heads and tails is observed.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many different sequences are possible?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
2^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 In how how many of these sequences are there exactly 4 heads?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
{10 \choose 4}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

			<title>Dinner Party</title>
			<idx><h>Dinner Party</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
A woman has 9 close friends.

			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 In how many ways can she invite 6 of them to dinner?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
{9 \choose 6}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Repeat (a) if two of her friends don't get along and will not attend together.

<!--solution>
<p>
We give three solutions.

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 First, we have
<me>
{7 \choose 5} + {7 \choose 5} + {7 \choose 6} = 49
</me>
corresponding to inviting friend one (and not friend two), inviting friend two (and not friend one), and inviting neither of them.


			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Second, we have
<me>
{9 \choose 6} - {7 \choose 4} = 49
</me>
using the classic "good = all - bad" theorem. There are <m>{9 \choose 6}</m> ways to invite any six people, and there are <m>{7 \choose 4}</m> ways to invite the two people who don't get along.

			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Finally, let's use inclusion-exclusion. We have
<me>
{8 \choose 6} + {8 \choose 6} - {7 \choose 6} = 28 + 28 - 7 =  49
</me>
corresponding to   <m>|A \cup B|  = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|</m> where <m>A</m> is  the set of the parties with the first friend but not the second and <m>B</m> is the set of  parties with the second friend but not  the first.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Repeat (a) if her friends consist of 3 single people and 3 married couples, so that she must invite both spouses, or neither of them.

<!--solution>
<p>
We must invite two or three couples, which gives:
<me>
{3 \choose 2} {3 \choose 2} + {3 \choose 3} = 3 \times 3 + 1 = 10.
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

			<title>10 Points</title>
			<idx><h>10 Points</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Ten points in a plane, no three colinear, are given.

			<ol>


				<li>
					<p>
 Every pair of points determines a unique line. So how many different lines are formed by joining pairs of these points?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
{10 \choose 2}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Assume that none of the lines in  part (a)  are parallel and no three lines intersect at a single point.  How many different triangles are formed by these lines? (Note that the corners of  many of these triangles
are at points other than the original 10 points!)

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
{{10 \choose 2} \choose 3}
</me>
We need to choose a 3-set of the lines.
</p>
</solution-->

How many ways can a club with 20 members choose an executive board consisting of a president, a secretary, a treasurer, and two other members?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
{20 \choose 1} {19 \choose 1} {18 \choose 1} {17 \choose 2}
</me>
corresponding to choosing the president, then the secretary, then the treasurer, and finally the last two members.
