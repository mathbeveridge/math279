In each of the following problems, give an example of a function <m>f: [n] \rightarrow [m]</m> of the specified type. <em>You get to pick the values for <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>.</em> Describe your function by using a picture. Then decide if there is a required relationship between <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>, the sizes of the domain and the codomain (also called the "target").

				<li>
					<p>
 Create a function <m>f: [n] \rightarrow [m]</m> that is injective (one-to-one) but NOT surjective (onto). What is the required relationship between <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>? (One of: <m>n  &gt;m</m> or <m>n &lt; m</m> or <m>n = m</m> or "none.")

List all the functions from <m>\{a,b,c \}</m> to <m>\{ x,y \}</m>. For example, one function <m>f_1</m> is given by <m>f_1(a)=x</m> and <m>f_1(b)=y</m> and <m>f_1(c)=y</m>.

How many functions are there from <m>\{a,b,c,d \}</m> to <m>\{x,y,z \}</m>? This time, justify your answer with an argument rather than listing all possible functions.

				<p>
For each of the functions below, decide whether it is injective and/or surjective. If it does not satisfy the property, explain why by giving an example that violates the property. If it does satisfy the property, then provide a proof.

				<li>
					<p>
 <m>f: \Z \rightarrow \Z</m> given by <m>\displaystyle{f(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}</m> where
<m>\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor</m> is the floor function, which "rounds down" to the nearest integer.


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 <m>g: \Z \rightarrow \Z</m> given by <m>g(n) = 4n -1</m>

				<li>
					<p>
 <m>h: \R \backslash \{ 0 \} \rightarrow \R</m> given by <m>\displaystyle{h(x) = \frac{x+1}{x}}</m>.
