			<title>Rolling 10 Dice</title>
			<idx><h>Rolling 10 Dice</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
We roll 6-sided die 10 times, and then list the outcomes in order as <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{10} )</m>. We are interested in counting the total number outcomes in which both  1 appears and 2 appears.  We break this process into multiple steps.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>X</m> be the set of all possible outcomes <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{10} )</m>. What is <m>|X|</m>?

<solution>
<p>
For each <m>x_i</m>, we have 6 possible rolls. By the product principle, the answer is
<me>
|X| = 6^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>X_1</m> be the set of outcomes that <em>do not </em> contain any 1's. I would call <m>X_1</m> the set of "bad outcomes for 1." What is <m>|X_1|</m>?

<solution>
<p>
For each <m>x_i</m>, we have 5 possible rolls since rolling a 1 is forbidden. By the product principle, the answer is
<me>
|X_1| = 5^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Define <m>X_2</m> in the same way as in part (b), where <m>X_2</m> is the set of "bad outcomes for 2." What is <m>|X_2|</m>?

<solution>
<p>
As in the previous problem the answer is
<me>
|X_2| = 5^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many outcomes are there in which neither 1 or 2 appears? How would you describe this set using the symbols <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m>?

<solution>
<p>
The set described is <m>X_1 \cap X_2</m>. This time, there are 4 numbers allowed for each role, so
<me>
|X_1 \cap X_2| = 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use inclusion-exclusion to find the number of outcomes in which either 1 does not or appear or 2 does not appear (or both do not appear). This account for all the "bad outcomes."

<solution>
<p>
<me>
|X_1 \cup X_2 | = |X_1| + | X_2| - |X_1 \cap X_2| = 5^{10} + 5^{10}  - 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now use your answer from part (d) to find the number of "good  outcomes." Namely, how many outcomes contain both 1 and 2?

<solution>
<p>
<me>
6^{10} - \left( 5^{10} + 5^{10}  - 4^{10}  \right) = 6^{10} - 2 \cdot 5^{10} + 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

			<title>I Hate 2, 5, and 7</title>
			<idx><h>I Hate 2, 5, and 7</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In this question, you will determine how many numbers between 1 and 140 are <em>not</em> divisible by any of 2, 5 or 7. As in the previous question, we  start by counting the complement of the set we are interested in (because it is easier to count).

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Negate the statement "<m>n</m> is not divisible by any of 2, 5 and 7."

<solution>
<p>
<m>n</m> is divisible by at least one of 2, 5 or 7
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 The set of numbers that you described in part (a) can be found using inclusion-exclusion. Do so.

<solution>
<p>
Let <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_5</m> and <m>A_7</m> be the set of numbers divisible by 2, 5, and 7, respectively. We have

<me>
\begin{array}{ccc}
|A_2| = 70 &amp; |A_5| = 28 &amp; |A_7| = 20 \\
|A_2 \cap A_5| = 14 &amp; |A_2 \cap A_7| = 10 &amp; |A_5 \cap A_7| = 4 \\
&amp;|A_2 \cap A_5 \cap A_7| = 2 \\
\end{array}
</me>

By inclusion-exclusion the answer is
<me>
70+28+20 - 14 - 10 - 4 + 2 = 92
</me>
</p>
</solution>




					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use your answer to (b) to find how many numbers in [140] are <em>not</em> divisible by any of 2, 5 and 7.

<solution>
<p>
We use the useful theorem "good = all - bad" to find that
<me>
140 -92 = 48
</me>
</p>
</solution>

			<title>Sharing French Fries</title>
			<idx><h>Sharing French Fries</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Anna, Boris, Clyde and Denise are sharing a basket of 50 french fries. How many ways
are there for them to share the fries, assuming nobody gets more than 15 fries?
<ol>
<li>
<p>How many ways are there, with no restrictions, to distribute 50 identical french fries
among 4 distinct friends?
<solution>
<p>
We have 50 identical fries (balls) to give to 4 distinct friends (boxes). Repetition is allowed
and boxes can be empty. The number of ways is <m>{50+4-1 \choose 50} = {53 \choose 50}</m>.
</p>
</solution>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let <m>A</m> be the set of outcomes in which Anna gets 16 or more fries. What is <m>|A|</m>? 
(Hint: first give away 16 fries to Anna, 
then distribute the rest freely among the 4 friends.)
Define similar sets <m>B,C,D</m> for Boris, Clyde and Denise. Find <m>|A|+|B|+|C|+|D|</m>.
<solution>
After reserving 16 fries for Anna, we have 34 fries left over, to distribute any way we like.
The number of ways is <m>{34+4-1 \choose 50} = {37 \choose 34}</m>. 
The same argument holds for Boris, Clyde and Denise. so
<me>
|A|+|B|+|C|+|D| = 4 {37 \choose 34}.
</me>
</solution>
</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p>What is <m>|A \cap B|</m>? (Hint: first give away 16 fries to Anna and 16 more to Boris, 
then distribute the rest freely.) What is <m>| A \cap B| + | A \cap C| + | A \cap D| +
| B \cap C| + | B \cap D| + | C \cap D|</m>?
<solution>
After reserving 16 fries for Anna, and 16 fries for Boris, we have 18 fries left over, to distribute any way we like.
The number of ways is <m>{18+4-1 \choose 18} = {21 \choose 18}</m>. 
The same argument holds for any pair of friends, so 
<me>
| A \cap B| + | A \cap C| + | A \cap D| +
| B \cap C| + | B \cap D| + | C \cap D|= 6 {21 \choose 18}.
</me>
</solution>
</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p>Use similar reasoning to part (c) to find the sum of the sizes of all intersections involving 3 of
the sets <m>A,B,C,D</m>.
<solution>
After reserving 16 fries for Anna, and 16 fries for Boris, and 16 fries for Clyde, 2 fries left over, 
to distribute any way we like.
The number of ways is <m>{2+4-1 \choose 18} = {5 \choose 2}</m>. 
The same argument holds for any triple of friends, so 
<me>
| A \cap B \cap C| + | A \cap B \cap D| + | A \cap C \cap D| +
| B \cap C \cap D| = 4 {5 \choose 3}.
</me>
</solution>
</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p>Find <m>|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|</m>.
<solution>
There are not enough fries to give 16 fries to each of 4 people. So <m>|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|=0</m>
</solution>
</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p>Use inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of ways for the friends to share 50 fries where
no one gets more than 15 fries. 
<solution>
Our final answer is
<me>
{53 \choose 50} - 4 {37 \choose 34} + 6 {21 \choose 18} - 4 {5 \choose 3} + 0.
</me>
</solution>
</p>
