			<title>Rolling 10 Dice</title>
			<idx><h>Rolling 10 Dice</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
We roll 6-sided die 10 times, and then list the outcomes in order as <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{10} )</m>. We are interested in counting the total number outcomes in which both  1 appears and 2 appears.  We break this process into multiple steps.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>X</m> be the set of all possible outcomes <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{10} )</m>. What is <m>|X|</m>?

<!--solution>
<p>
For each <m>x_i</m>, we have 6 possible rolls. By the product principle, the answer is
<me>
|X| = 6^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>X_1</m> be the set of outcomes that <em>do not </em> contain any 1's. I would call <m>X_1</m> the set of "bad outcomes for 1." What is <m>|X_1|</m>?

<!--solution>
<p>
For each <m>x_i</m>, we have 5 possible rolls since rolling a 1 is forbidden. By the product principle, the answer is
<me>
|X_1| = 5^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Define <m>X_2</m> in the same way as in part (b), where <m>X_2</m> is the set of "bad outcomes for 2." What is <m>|X_2|</m>?

<!--solution>
<p>
As in the previous problem the answer is
<me>
|X_2| = 5^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 How many outcomes are there in which neither 1 or 2 appears? How would you describe this set using the symbols <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m>?

<!--solution>
<p>
The set described is <m>X_1 \cap X_2</m>. This time, there are 4 numbers allowed for each role, so
<me>
|X_1 \cap X_2| = 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use inclusion-exclusion to find the number of outcomes in which either 1 does not or appear or 2 does not appear (or both do not appear). This account for all the "bad outcomes."

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
|X_1 \cup X_2 | = |X_1| + | X_2| - |X_1 \cap X_2| = 5^{10} + 5^{10}  - 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now use your answer from part (d) to find the number of "good  outcomes." Namely, how many outcomes contain both 1 and 2?

<!--solution>
<p>
<me>
6^{10} - \left( 5^{10} + 5^{10}  - 4^{10}  \right) = 6^{10} - 2 \cdot 5^{10} + 4^{10}
</me>
</p>
</solution-->

			<title>I Hate 2, 5, and 7</title>
			<idx><h>I Hate 2, 5, and 7</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In this question, you will determine how many numbers between 1 and 140 are <em>not</em> divisible by any of 2, 5 or 7. As in the previous question, we  start by counting the complement of the set we are interested in (because it is easier to count).

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Negate the statement "<m>n</m> is not divisible by any of 2, 5 and 7."

<!--solution>
<p>
<m>n</m> is divisible by at least one of 2, 5 or 7
</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 The set of numbers that you described in part (a) can be found using inclusion-exclusion. Do so.

<!--solution>
<p>
Let <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_5</m> and <m>A_7</m> be the set of numbers divisible by 2, 5, and 7, respectively. We have

<me>
\begin{array}{ccc}
|A_2| = 70 &amp; |A_5| = 28 &amp; |A_7| = 20 \\
|A_2 \cap A_5| = 14 &amp; |A_2 \cap A_7| = 10 &amp; |A_5 \cap A_7| = 4 \\
&amp;|A_2 \cap A_5 \cap A_7| = 2 \\
\end{array}
</me>

By inclusion-exclusion the answer is
<me>
70+28+20 - 14 - 10 - 4 + 2 = 92
</me>
</p>
</solution-->




					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use your answer to (b) to find how many numbers in [140] are <em>not</em> divisible by any of 2, 5 and 7.

<!--solution>
<p>
We use the useful theorem "good = all - bad" to find that
<me>
140 -92 = 48
</me>
</p>
</solution-->
